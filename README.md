## WorkspaceApp
This app allows you to signup for premier work-spaces and events, whether you need a pass for a day, a dedicated desk for your business, or an office suite for your entire company.

Developed using Typescript, CSS3, HTML 5 and .NET CORE REST API.
The app can perfom all the CRUD operations-for creating, reading, updating and deleting various components(workspaces,events,services etc). For the backend, 
I am using a REST WEB service.

This project was generated with [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/) version 4.2.1.

## Development server

Start the server using command -  `ionic serve(for browser view)` or `ionic lab(for mobile view)`.
